They are different but they don't know it and between them \"the greatest friendship in the world\" is born, impervious to the divisions of history that bloodies Europe.  But on October 16 the Jewish boy is taken away by the Germans together with over a thousand people from the Ghetto.  Thanks to Italo's father Federale, the three friends believe they know where he is and, to honor the \"spit pact\", decide to leave in secret to convince the Germans to free their friend.  Yet another imaginative mission becomes reality, the three children travel alone in an Italy exhausted by war, among disbanded soldiers, deserters, occupying German troops, exhausted and hungry populations.",

The 1980s brought not only freedom, but also waves of crime on the city streets. While some young people began to ‘grow up’ on the streets, others found it difficult to find their place in this unpredictable reality. Andrey, lives with his mother and five-year-old sister. He studies at a music school and often encounters street teenagers who harass him. To protect himself, Andrey makes friends with one of these teenagers, Marat, who introduces him to gang life. Youth groups fight for every piece of territory; they defend their right to live the life, even breaking laws and promises. The only thing that matters to them is the vows they make to their gang members-brothers, with whom they confront the violence and fears of the adult world.",
