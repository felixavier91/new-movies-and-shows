That precious routine runs smoothly until a new person is admitted to the same ward. She is a restless, angry companion, she accepts nothing of that condition, especially the unwritten rules. She is not willing to wait, she wants to leave that place better or even worse. She wants to live as she should or die, as happens to those who end up in there. He is overwhelmed by that fury, first trying to defend himself and then accepting something incomprehensible. That encounter will help him accept that if you choose to truly face your heart and your emotions, there is no possible repair.",

In order to expand its territory, it attacks the sects around the Sea, including the Yuntian Sect. Li Muwan is poisoned in the battle to protect the gate, leaving her life at stake. After Wang Lin learns of this, he takes her into the Sea again. Wang Lin fights the three city lords with his initial cultivation of the God of Incarnation, and becomes famous in the Sea.

As Ife deals with confusing cramps, weirdly casual medical staff, and her mother's cryptic warnings, the couple faces a terrifying yet darkly comedic reality about motherhood, health-care, and family secrets. Equal parts surreal and hilarious, this film flips the script on what it means to be a mother-especially when the stakes are higher than you'd expect.",

The investigation is taken up by the determined criminalist Laura Linhartová (Kristýna Ryška), and her old colleague Adam Beneš (Kryštof Hádek) is assigned to her. The main suspect is a recently convicted perpetrator who is responsible for a similar murder. Just when it seems that the search for Anna's murderer is over, new evidence appears that brings the whole case back to the beginning. The criminalists thus embark on a complicated investigation full of unexpected twists and turns. The circle of suspects in the small town expands dramatically. The tension between Laura and Adam rises, not to mention their different characters and shared past. And the question still hangs in the air: Who killed Anna Pittnerová?",

Accusers say that Tang Lici is a traitor who murdered his master. A decade later, suspicions about Tang Lici linger, but much darker forces are conspiring to unleash chaos into the realm. Torn by his duality and his apparent inability to distinguish between good and evil, Tang Lici finds himself drawn back into the wider world to help defeat the evil conspiracy – armed only with his wits and his martial arts skills.

The story unfolds through Pietro's loss of innocence, along with his brothers and lifelong friends, their ambitions, and his first great love, which, like that of every teenager, will be wild and passionate. His encounter with Angelo, known as 'A Sirena,' the regent of Secondigliano, marks his entry into the world of crime.
